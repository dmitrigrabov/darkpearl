## Competitive Position

### AMCS Bid Strategy (Predicted)

**Arguments**:
1. Continuity - No disruption to operations
2. Data - All data already in AMCS
3. Upgrade path - Modern AMCS Platform available
4. Relationship - 9 years of working together
5. Knowledge - Deep understanding of council operations

**Counter-Arguments to Prepare**:

| AMCS Claim | Counter-Argument |
|------------|------------------|

| "No migration needed" | Council deserves modern architecture; migration is manageable |
| "We know your processes" | We will invest in discovery; bring fresh perspective and best practices |
| "Upgrade to new platform" | If upgrade was viable, why hasn't it happened already? |
| "Switching costs" | TCO comparison will show long-term value |

### Incumbent Vulnerabilities

**Exploit These**:

1. **Support History**
   - If council has experienced slow support, highlight SLA commitments
   - Offer named account manager and escalation paths

2. **Hidden Costs**
   - AMCS charges for customization and reports
   - Offer transparent, all-inclusive pricing

3. **Bug History**
   - Reference AMCS platform stability issues
   - Emphasize QA processes and release management

4. **Oracle Integration**
   - Current system may not integrate well with Oracle Fusion
   - Demonstrate Oracle integration capability

5. **Modern UX**
   - 2016 system likely has dated interface
   - Show modern, consumer-grade user experience

## Data Migration Considerations

### Data in AMCS System

Likely to include:
- Customer master data
- Contract records
- Service history
- Invoicing records
- Payment history
- Route definitions
- Vehicle and asset data
- Weight records
- Weighbridge transactions

### Migration Approach

1. **Early Access** - Request AMCS data access in discovery
2. **Schema Analysis** - Document AMCS 7 data structures
3. **Quality Assessment** - Identify data quality issues
4. **Transformation Rules** - Define mapping to new system
5. **Trial Migrations** - Multiple test runs with validation
6. **Parallel Running** - Consider overlap period

### Migration Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| AMCS non-cooperation | Council to mandate data access in contract exit |
| Data quality issues | Budget for cleansing and manual corrections |
| Historical data volume | Focus on active data; archive historical |
| Custom fields | Document all customizations early |
